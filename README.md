# altsource-viewer
View your favorite AltStore source, made with vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## Get started
Simply paste the URL of an AltStore source to begin. [Try it here!](https://therealfoxster.github.io/altsource-viewer/)

> [!NOTE]
> If a source can't be viewed, it is highly likely due to a CORS restriction set by the server hosting the JSON file. To my knowledge, a JSON file hosted on GitHub (via GitHub Pages) does not have this problem.
